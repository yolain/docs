  <Step title="Resolve Dependency Conflicts (Optional)" >
    If EasyUse still fails to load after completing the first two steps and running ComfyUI, it is usually due to dependency conflicts. You can try the following methods to troubleshoot the issue:

    `1. Check ComfyUI Run Logs`
     - After running ComfyUI, you can find the `comfyui.log` and `comfyui.prev.log` files in the root directory. Open them with a text editor to check for error messages related to Easy-Use (the same method applies to other node packages).

     <Frame caption="1-2. This section only shows the startup results of various node packages. You can see that EasyUse failed to load, but the reason is not visible">
     <img src="../../images/get-started/win_install_dep_2.jpg" />

     <Frame caption="1-3. Search for easy-use to find related error reasons, and copy the error content">

     </Frame>
    `2. Search for Related Issues on GitHub or Ask GPT or Ask the Developer on GitHub`
